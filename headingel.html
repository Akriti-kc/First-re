    <h1>Differentiate between Inline and block elements.</h1>
    <span>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.<br>
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br>
        Two commonly used block elements are:p and div.<br> whereas
        <br>
            An inline element does not start on a new line.<br>
        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
        This is a span element inside a paragraph.
        </span>
